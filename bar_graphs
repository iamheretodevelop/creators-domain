# You are given an array of no. that represent heights on a bar graph. A bucket of water is dropped on the bar graph. Write a function to determine how much water would be retained by the graph.

# Examples 
# [1,0,2,1,3] = 2

#              _      
#        _    |  |
#  _   |  | _ |  |
# |  |_|  |   |  |

# [3,2,1,2,3] = 4
# [1,6,3,2,2,5,0,1,2] = 6

# all of the heights on the bar graph have the same height

# [1, 0, 9, 4, 5, 8, 7, 4]
